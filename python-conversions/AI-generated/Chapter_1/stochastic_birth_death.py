"""
This Python script simulates a birthâ€“death process using the Gillespie (stochastic) algorithm,
and also solves a corresponding system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
to obtain extinction probabilities. The code is written with detailed comments to help beginners understand
each step. You can modify the parameters and structure as needed for your own work.

Reactions simulated:
  1. Death:      S -> I      at rate alpha    (reduces the number of individuals S by 1, increases deaths I by 1)
  2. Birth:      S -> 2S     at rate beta     (increases the number of individuals S by 1, I remains unchanged)
